        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>
            Hello! My name is William Sharp! I am currently in my second year at <a
                href="https://flc.losrios.edu">Folsom Lake College</a>. I am studying
            Physics, hoping to focus on nuclear physics or quantum mechanics related research. My favorite pastimes
            include:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Playing guitar</li>
            <li>Coding</li>
            <li>Astrophotography</li>
            <li>Photography</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Each of these hobbies allows me to express my emotions and test my weaknesses and
            strengths as a critical thinker. I don't do these things to look impressive; they are simply things I find
            extremely enjoyable.
            Sure, they <i>can</i> impress others, but that isn't my goal.
        </p>

        <h1>Project History</h1>
        <p>
            At the age of 18, I made a macOS app that aided in the detection of radioactive isotopes using external
            scintillation probe sensors. THIS is the project that got me into quantum mechanics. I learned about quarks,
            the quantum phasing of alpha
            particles, the emission of gamma particles, and even the transformation of up and down quarks in beta decay
            reactions.
            This can be viewed on the <a href="CodeProjects.html">Coding Projects Page</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            After that, I made another Python project which visualized the simulation of beams and electron
            probability clouds. It's a little primitive, but it gets the job done. This project can also be viewed on
            the <a href="CodeProjects.html">Coding Projects
                Page</a>. This project was extremely math-intensive as I used matrices, vectors, and algebraic functions
            to calculate the trajectory of everything.
        </p>



        <h1>My Analytical Approach</h1>
        <p>
            I have always been driven by an intense curiosity that pushes me to explore topics well beyond the standard
            curriculum.
            I view mathematics not just as a school subject, but as a lens through which to view the world.
            For instance, while taking basic Algebra, I began self-studying Calculus concepts. During Trigonometry, I
            was already
            applying those principles to my independent studies on mechanical waves.
        </p>
        <p>
            This proactive approach has allowed me to develop a unique intuition for data analysis. I frequently apply
            mathematical modeling to everyday scenarios, including video games.
        </p>
        <h3>Skill Highlight: Data Linearization</h3>
        <p>
            I have developed a strong proficiency in turning raw data into functional formulas. My process includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Isolating input and output variables from data sets.</li>
            <li>Charting data points and performing logarithmic operations to identify exponential relationships.</li>
            <li><strong>Practical Application:</strong> I recently developed a formula to optimize efficiency in a game
                economy.
                By determining variable relationships and integrating the "items per hour" function, I was able to
                successfully
                predict yield over time with high accuracy.
            </li>
        </ul>



        <h1>Coding</h1>
        <p>
            This is the coolest part about myself. I can successfully turn my mathematics and skills into a machine
            (even
            possibly an extension of myself) just by writing some code. I mostly use Python due to its versatility and
            access to a large list of libraries and documentation,
            but I am familiar with a lot of other coding languages. Here are some:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>Swift</li>
            <li>Swift UI</li>
            <li>Javascript</li>
            <li>Java (very minor experience)</li>
            <li>LaTeX</li>
            <li>Lua</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Head to the <a href="CodeProjects.html">Coding Projects Page</a> to see a summary of my recent projects.
            My obsession with coding started when I was around 13 when I was introduced to Lua. I quickly realized I
            could
            get more out of my work with higher-power languages like Python.
        </p>

        <h1>Photography & Astrophotography</h1>
        <p>
            When I am out in the wilderness I find myself wanting to "save" the moment. There is just something
            about being able to capture something as fast as a flying bird, or as slow as a creek rolling downstream.
            Although I mostly do
            wildlife photography, I find myself capturing landscapes I find amusing. Head to my <a
                href="Photography.html">Photography page</a> to see some of
            my recent photographs.
        </p>
        <p>
            This interest in "capturing the moment" reaches even into my science studies. In fact, I was able to capture
            a photo of the M31 galaxy (my proudest work so far). Since then my luck has run dry and the weather hasn't
            cleared up when I wanted it to.
            The M31 photo will also be on my <a href="Photography.html">Photography page</a>.
